This app will serve as a simple tracker for the  weight of two cats. The associated database will feature basic CRUD operations

* creating an entry in the form of a measured weight on a selected day

* reading data from the database

* updating an entry

* deleting an entry

I'd like to represent the cats with simple 8 bit graphics and show a graph to visualize weight history. I might even include if the weight is healthy or not and add breakpoints that show dietary changes
